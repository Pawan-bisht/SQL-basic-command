SELECT <column-name> from <table-name>

Ex
SELECT * FROM cats; 

SELECT name FROM cats; 

SELECT age FROM cats; 

SELECT cat_id FROM cats; 

SELECT name, age FROM cats;


WHERE clause 
in SELECT * from <table_name> where <condition>

In Sql string is INCASE-SENSITIVE
ex  

    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='egG';

    Both the queries SELECT the same record

    We can also compare tow columns;
    ex 
    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE cat_id=age;   

-----------------------ALIASES -----------------------------
These are usfull when we join tables, those having same column name.
So its difficult to differentiate between them.That's why we use ALIASES;

Ex

SELECT cat_id As Id,name AS cat_name from <table_name>


-----------------------UPDATE -------------------------------

UPDATE <table_name> SET <column_name> = <value> where <condition>

Always do select * before the update command


-----------------------DELETE -------------------------------
DELETE use to delete a particular or set of record.
Ex
    DELETE FROM <table_name> where <condition> 
This delete the particular or set of record from table

BUT  
    DELETE FROM <table_name>

    It deletes the every record in the table.coz condition doent meat anything.
    But the table is not deleted. table is still their in the memory but as an 
    empty table or shell.

    SELECT *  FROM cats WHERE cat_id=age;
