SELECT <column-name> from <table-name>

Ex
SELECT * FROM cats; 

SELECT name FROM cats; 

SELECT age FROM cats; 

SELECT cat_id FROM cats; 

SELECT name, age FROM cats;


WHERE clause 
in SELECT * from <table_name> where <condition>

In Sql string is INCASE-SENSITIVE
ex  

    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='egG';

    Both the queries SELECT the same record

    We can also compare tow columns;
    ex 
    SELECT * FROM cats WHERE cat_id=age;
